## Developer Guide

Analytics kit provide some [Automatically Collected Events](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides-V5/android-automatic-event-collection-0000001051757143-V5). Such events can be automatically collected without extra coding, and the only requirement is that the function of collecting system events is enabled. (The function is automatically enabled during initiation.)

When the analysis service plug-in is started, the initialization of the SDK has been called, and the developer does not need to call it again.

### Custom Events

`onEvent(eventId: any, params: any): void`

Such events can be used to meet personalized analysis requirements that cannot be met by automatically collected events and predefined events.

You may need personalized events for logging and analytics. Analytics Kit allows you to customize events and extend event parameters, or add personalized parameters for predefined events.

For example, you can add custom event `begin_examination` to indicate the event of entering a new exam and add the `exam_difficulty` parameter to define the exam difficulty.

**Parameter Description**:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|eventId|Event ID. It is consisting of numbers, letters and underscores, cannot start with a number, cannot contain spaces, cannot exceed 256 characters in length, cannot use [Automatically Collected Events](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides-V5/android-automatic-event-collection-0000001051757143-V5). It is recommended to use [Predefined Events](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides-V5/android-predefined-events-0000001051997159-V5) first.|
|params|Information carried in the event. The number of built-in key-value pairs in the Bundle cannot exceed 2048 and the size cannot exceed 200 KB. The key value in the Bundle can consist of digits, letters, and underscores (_) but cannot start with a digit.|

**Example**:

```JavaScript
let eventName = 'myEvent';
let params = {
    name: 'userName',
    age: 18,
    others: {
        stature: 199,
        level: 100
    }
};

huawei.hms.analytics.analyticsService.onEvent(eventName, params);
```

### Selectable functions

#### Specifies whether to enable event collection

`setAnalyticsEnabled(enable: boolean): void`

Specifies whether to enable event collection. If the function is disabled, no data is recorded.

**Parameter Description**:

```

#### Sets a user ID

`setUserId(userId: string): void`

When the API is called, a new session is generated if the old value of **userId* is not empty and is different from the new value. If you do not want to use **userId** to identify a user (for example, when a user signs out), you must set id to `null`.

The **userId** is used by Analytics Kit to associate user data. The use of **userId** must comply with related privacy regulations. You need to declare the use of such information in the privacy statement of your app.

**Parameter Description**:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|userId|User ID, a string containing a maximum of 256 characters. The value cannot be empty.|

**Example**:

```

#### Sets user attributes

`setUserProfile(name: string, value: string): void`

Sets user attributes. The values of user attributes remain unchanged throughout the app lifecycle and during each session. A maximum of 25 user attributes are supported. If the name of an attribute set later is the same as that of an existing attribute, the value of the existing attribute is updated.

Analytics Kit automatically collects some user attributes. You can use these attributes without extra coding.

**Parameter Description**:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|name|Name of the user attribute, a string containing a maximum of 256 characters excluding spaces and invisible characters. The value cannot be empty.|
|value|Value of the user attribute, a string containing a maximum of 256 characters, pass `null` or `undefined` to delete the corresponding user attribute.|

**Parameter Description**:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|token|Push token, a string containing a maximum of 256 characters. The value cannot be empty.|

**Example**:

```JavaScript
huawei.hms.analytics.analyticsService.setPushToken("XXX");
```

#### Sets the minimum interval for starting a new session

`setMinActivitySessions(time: number): void`

    console.log('getUserProfiles...', JSON.stringify(result));
});
```

#### Defines a custom page entry event

`pageStart(pageName: string, pageClassOverride: string): void`

Customizes a page entry event. The API applies only to non-activity pages because automatic collection is supported for activity pages. If this API is called for an activity page, statistics on page entry and exit events will be inaccurate.

After this API is called, the `pageEnd()` API must be called.

**Parameter Description**:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|pageName|Name of the current page, a string containing a maximum of 256 characters. The value cannot be empty.|

```

#### Sets the automatic event reporting policy

`setReportPolicies(...reportPolicies: ReportPolicy[])`

**Parameter Description**:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|policies|Policy for data reporting. Four policies are supported, and multiple policies can be set at the same time.<br>**ON_APP_LAUNCH_POLICY**: An event is reported immediately when this policy is set. After that, an event is reported each time the app is started.<br>**ON_MOVE_BACKGROUND_POLICY**: This event is reported when an app is switched to the background (including app exit).<br>**ON_SCHEDULED_TIME_POLICY**: An event is reported at the specified interval. The value ranges from 60 to 1800, in seconds. If the specified value is beyond the value range, the boundary value is used.<br>**ON_CACHE_THRESHOLD_POLICY**: An event is reported when the number of cached events reaches the threshold. The value ranges from 30 to 1000. The default value is 30. If the specified value is beyond the value range, the boundary value is used.|

**Note**:

- The preceding reporting policies take effect only when the debug mode is disabled.

- **onMoveBackgroundPolicy** and **onCacheThresholdPolicy** are default policies. If no policy is set, the two policies automatically take effect. If **onMoveBackgroundPolicy** is not included in the configured event reporting policies, this policy will not take effect.

- **onCacheThresholdPolicy** is mandatory. This policy is effective no matter what policy has been configured. You can change the threshold as needed.

- Event reporting policies will be updated if a policy setting API is called multiple times. Only the policy set by the last API is effective.

- When a policy is met and event reporting is triggered, the event is cached locally if no network is available and will be reported again when reporting conditions are met next time.

- The specified event reporting policies are saved persistently.

- If the app is uninstalled when only **onAppLaunchPolicy** or **onScheduledTimePolicy** is specified, events of the app may be lost.

**Example**:

```JavaScript
let ReportPolicy = huawei.hms.analytics.ReportPolicy;
let moveBackgroundPolicy = ReportPolicy.ON_MOVE_BACKGROUND_POLICY;
let scheduledTimePolicy = ReportPolicy.ON_SCHEDULED_TIME_POLICY;
scheduledTimePolicy.threshold = 600;
