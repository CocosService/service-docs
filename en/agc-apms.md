# APM (AppGallery Connect) Quick Start

[App Performance Management (APM) ](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/agconnect/apm)Service of HUAWEI AppGallery Connect provides minute-level app performance monitoring capabilities. You can view and analyze app performance data collected by APM in AppGallery Connect to comprehensively understand the performance features of developed apps, helping you quickly and accurately rectify possible performance problems and continuously improve user experience.

### Functions

|Function|Description|
|-|-|
|Automatically collects performance data about app launches, app screen rendering, and HTTP/HTTPS network requests.|The APM SDK automatically collects key performance data about app launches, app screen rendering, and HTTP/HTTPS network requests.<br>1. App launch: app launch time in cold and warm launch modes.<br>2. App screen rendering: number of slow frames and frozen frames during app screen rendering.<br>3. HTTP/HTTPS network request: indicators such as the response duration, success rate, and response size.|
|Allows you to view and analyze app performance data to accurately identify the aspects that can be improved.|APM displays app performance indicators from multiple dimensions (such as the version number, country/region, device model, level-1 region, system version, carrier, and network), helping you quickly understand the aspects that can be improved.|
|Allows you to create custom traces to monitor app performance data in specific scenarios.|With the APM SDK, you can:<br>1. Create custom traces to monitor your app's performance in scenarios such as sign-in and scene loading.<br>2. Add indicators (such as the number of sign-in times) and properties (such as whether the sign-in is successful) for a custom trace.|

    ![image.png](agc-apms/image.png)

- If APM is not enabled in the [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html) console, go to **Quality -> APM** , click **Enable** button to enable the service.

    ![image.png](agc-apms/image 1.png)

### Configs HUAWEI Config File

Most of HUAWEI Services need the `agconnect-services.json` configuration file. If there are operations such as newly opened services, please update the file in time.

- Sign in to [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html) find your project from the project list and select the app on the project card.

- On the **Project Setting** page, click the configuration file **agconnect-services.json** to download it. The `agconnect-services.json` file **must be copied manually** to the `settings` directory of the project directory after downloading or updating.

    ![image.png](agc-apms/image 2.png)

- For Creator v2.4.3 and above, if you want to publish to the [HUAWEI AppGallery Connect](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/publish/publish-huawei-agc.html), you can select the downloaded or updated configuration file directly in the **Build** panel, no need to copy it manually.

## Sample Project

Developer can get a quick taste of the APM service with the sample project.

- Click on the **Sample** button in the APM service panel, clone or download, and open the project in Cocos Creator.

- After enabling the APM service and configuring the HUAWEI configuration file as described above, you can open the **Build** panel to compile the project by clicking **Project -> Build** in the Creator editor menu bar. Cocos Creator v2.4.1 and above, you could publish to HUAWEI AppGallery Connect. Below Creator v2.4.1 could publish to the Android platform.

- Once the Sample project is running on the phone, click the **APMS** button on the homepage for testing.

    ![image.png](agc-apms/image 3.png)

### Verify whether the service is integrated successfully

- Once the APM service is integrated, you can publish to the Android platform without changing your code. Please make sure that the **Package Name** on the **Build** panel is consistent with the **Package Name** set in the AppGallery Connect console.

- Login the [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html) console, open the project, go to **Quality -> APM**. If you can see App Performance information (usually displayed within 15 minutes), which means the integrate is successful.

## Developer Guide

### Enables or disables APM

`enableCollection(enable: boolean): void`

The default value is true, indicating that APM app performance data collection is enabled. To disable app performance data collection of APM, set this parameter to false. You can refer to [Disabling APM Performance Monitoring in Apps](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-apm-android-stopapm-0000001052807287#section38651053241) documentation for details.

The priority of the disabling configuration in apps is **higher** than that through Remote Configuration in AppGallery Connect. If users disable performance monitoring in apps, the APM does not collect performance data even if the performance monitoring function is enabled through Remote Configuration in AppGallery Connect.

**Parameter Description**:

|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|
|enable|Indicates whether to enable APM to collect performance monitoring data.<br>**true**: performance data collection is enabled.<br>**false**: performance data collection is disable.|
